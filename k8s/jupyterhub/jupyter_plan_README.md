# Scalable JupyterHub Deployment on Kubernetes

## Objective

Deploy JupyterHub on a Kubernetes cluster to create a multi-user, scalable, and containerized data science environment.

## Project Overview

This project involves setting up JupyterHub using Kubernetes, allowing multiple users to work with Jupyter notebooks in isolated environments.  This scalable solution will utilize Kubernetes' orchestration capabilities, providing a practical understanding of Kubernetes in a data science context.

## Steps

### Learn Basic Concepts

Familiarize ourselves with basic Kubernetes concepts like Pods, Deployments, Services, and Ingress.

### Set Up a Kubernetes Cluster

We will set up a cluster on our local machines using Minikube, or use a cloud provider like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Amazon EKS, or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

### Install Helm

Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes, will be used to install JupyterHub.

### Deploy JupyterHub with Helm

- Add the JupyterHub Helm chart repository.
- Create a `config.yaml` file to configure our JupyterHub deployment.
- Deploy JupyterHub to our Kubernetes cluster using the Helm chart.

### Access JupyterHub

Once deployed, access JupyterHub through a web browser.  We'll need to set up an Ingress controller or use port-forwarding to access the service.

### Experiment with Scalability

Try scaling our JupyterHub deployment by increasing or decreasing the number of users and observe how Kubernetes manages these changes.

### Explore Advanced Features

- Set up persistent storage for notebooks so that data is retained across sessions.
- Configure resource limits and requests for user notebooks.
- Integrate with authentication services for user management.

## Documentation

Document our setup process, configuration, and learnings.  This can be part of our GitHub repository as a markdown file.

## Bonus - Continuous Deployment

Set up a CI/CD pipeline for our JupyterHub configuration using tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions.  This will automate the deployment process of our JupyterHub setup.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding of how Kubernetes can be used to deploy, manage, and scale applications.
- Practical experience in deploying a data science environment on Kubernetes.
- Knowledge of Helm and how to use it to manage Kubernetes applications.

This project offers a mix of DBRE and data science, providing a practical understanding of how Kubernetes can be leveraged in a data science context.
