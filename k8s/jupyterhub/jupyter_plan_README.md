# Scalable JupyterHub Deployment on Kubernetes

## Objective

Deploy JupyterHub on a Kubernetes cluster to create a multi-user, scalable, and containerized data science environment.

## Project Overview

This project involves setting up JupyterHub using Kubernetes, allowing multiple users to work with Jupyter notebooks in isolated environments. This scalable solution will utilize Kubernetes' orchestration capabilities, providing a practical understanding of Kubernetes in a data science context.

## Steps

### Learn Basic Concepts

Familiarize yourself with basic Kubernetes concepts like Pods, Deployments, Services, and Ingress.

### Set Up a Kubernetes Cluster

You can set up a cluster on your local machine using Minikube, or use a cloud provider like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Amazon EKS, or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

### Install Helm

Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes, will be used to install JupyterHub.

### Deploy JupyterHub with Helm

- Add the JupyterHub Helm chart repository.
- Create a `config.yaml` file to configure your JupyterHub deployment.
- Deploy JupyterHub to your Kubernetes cluster using the Helm chart.

### Access JupyterHub

Once deployed, access JupyterHub through a web browser. You'll need to set up an Ingress controller or use port-forwarding to access the service.

### Experiment with Scalability

Try scaling your JupyterHub deployment by increasing or decreasing the number of users and observe how Kubernetes manages these changes.

### Explore Advanced Features

- Set up persistent storage for notebooks so that data is retained across sessions.
- Configure resource limits and requests for user notebooks.
- Integrate with authentication services for user management.

## Documentation

Document your setup process, configuration, and learnings. This can be part of your GitHub repository as a markdown file.

## Bonus - Continuous Deployment

Set up a CI/CD pipeline for your JupyterHub configuration using tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions. This will automate the deployment process of your JupyterHub setup.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding of how Kubernetes can be used to deploy, manage, and scale applications.
- Practical experience in deploying a data science environment on Kubernetes.
- Knowledge of Helm and how to use it to manage Kubernetes applications.

This project offers a mix of DBRE and data science, providing a practical understanding of how Kubernetes can be leveraged in a data science context. As you get more comfortable with Kubernetes, you can explore more complex projects, like setting up distributed data processing frameworks (e.g., Apache Spark) on Kubernetes, or implementing MLOps pipelines.
