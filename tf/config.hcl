# Steps to Deploy:
# Write Terraform configuration files as shown below.
# Initialize Terraform to install necessary plugins.
# `terraform init`
#
# Apply the Terraform plan to create resources.
# `terraform apply`
#
# Notes:
# Replace <PATH_TO_YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY.json>, <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>, <YOUR_REGION>, and example-user@example.com with your actual GCP service account key path, project ID, region, and user email.
# The permissions listed in google_project_iam_custom_role should be adjusted to match the specific requirements for your data scientists.
# This script assumes you have a service account key for Terraform to authenticate with GCP. Ensure this service account has the necessary roles to create IAM roles and policies.
# 
# Best Practices:
# Version Control: Store your Terraform configurations in a version control system.
# Modularize: Keep your Terraform configurations modular for reusability and maintainability.
# Review and Testing: Regularly review and test your IAM roles and policies.
# Security: Ensure that the service account key used by Terraform is stored securely and has minimal necessary permissions.
# This setup will create a custom role with specific permissions and assign it to specified users, providing the necessary access for data scientists in your GCP environment.
