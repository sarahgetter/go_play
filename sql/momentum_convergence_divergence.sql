-- Momentum of cryptocurrency prices. Momentum in trading
-- typically refers to the rate of acceleration of a security's
-- price or volume â€“ essentially measuring the speed at which
-- the price is changing.
--
-- This SQL query will calculate the 5-day moving average
-- of the price changes to gauge short-term momentum, and
-- compare it with a 30-day moving average to understand
-- longer-term trends. By comparing these two, you can get
-- an idea of whether short-term movements are aligning with
-- or diverging from longer-term trends, which could indicate
-- potential buy or sell signals.
--
-- DailyPrices CTE: Computes daily prices and the price of the previous day.
--
-- PriceChanges CTE: Calculates the daily percentage change for each token.
--
-- MovingAverages CTE: Computes the 5-day and 30-day moving averages of daily price changes for each symbol.
--
-- Final SELECT:
-- Compares short-term momentum (5-day MA) against long-term momentum (30-day MA).
-- Assigns a trend indicator, which could be useful for traders looking at momentum strategies.
--
-- This query provides an analytical view that can help traders or analysts identify if a cryptocurrency is currently
-- experiencing a momentum that is stronger or weaker than its recent trend, aiding in making more informed trading decisions.
