# Deployment and Execution:
# Deploy the Python scripts to our Airflow environment in Cloud Composer.
# Ensure that Cloud Composer has the necessary permissions to interact with other GCP services.
# Schedule and monitor our DAGs via the Airflow web interface provided by Cloud Composer.
#
# Environment Configuration:
# Set environment-specific configurations (like project IDs, GCS bucket names, etc.) in our DAG and scripts, preferably using Airflow Variables or Connections.
# For Kubernetes, use different namespaces or separate clusters for staging and production to isolate the environments.
